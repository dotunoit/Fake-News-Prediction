To create this basic fake news prediction script, a popular machine learning library called scikit-learn was used, which provides various algorithms for classification tasks. We'll use a dataset consisting of labeled news articles (fake or real) to train a classifier. 
Here's a breakdown of how the script works:

The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning operations, and metrics for evaluating the model.

We load the dataset from a CSV file called "news_dataset.csv". The dataset should have two columns: 'text' containing the news article text and 'label' indicating whether it is real or fake.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. We allocate 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

The news article text is converted into numerical features using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization technique. This process assigns weights to words based on their frequency in the article and across the dataset.

We train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel using the training set. SVM is a popular algorithm for text classification tasks.

The trained model is used to make predictions on the test set. The predicted labels are stored in y_pred.

Finally, we evaluate the model's accuracy by comparing the predicted labels (y_pred) with the true labels (y_test).

Note that this is a simplified example, and there are several other techniques and considerations to improve the performance of a fake news detection system. These include using more advanced natural language processing techniques, incorporating additional features (e.g., metadata, author information), and exploring different machine learning algorithms.

Additionally, building a comprehensive and accurate fake news detection system requires a large and diverse dataset, extensive feature engineering, and continuous model refinement. It's an active research area with ongoing advancements.
